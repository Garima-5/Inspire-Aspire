			It's almost ironic that Walmart is frequently criticized for underpaying its employees and using cutthroat tactics 
			to maximize profits. Sam Walton, Walmart's founder, had almost nothing to his name himself when he started his first 
			general store back in 1945.

He relied on a $25,000 loan from his father-in-law, and was an instant success in the retail industry. 
By 1976, Walmart was worth more than $176 million. 
At one point, Walton was considered the wealthiest man in the United States.
