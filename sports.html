	    At the age of 15, his best friend LeRoy Smith and he were asked to try to qualify for 
	    the high school team. While the coach was impressed with Michael’s skill and speed, the
	    youngster did not meet the minimum height requirement. He was devastated.

Watching his friend move up while he stayed behind was one of the most pivotal moments of his life.
Racked by disappointment, he went home but his mother urged him to prove the coach wrong. She cons-
oled him by saying that he would get taller by putting salt in his shoes and praying. From then on,
he trained relentlessly. He re-joined the junior team and his intense training paid off.

In the next couple of years, he would grow five inches and make it to the high school team. The 
year after that, he made it into the All-American High School Team.His failures didn’t stop there, 
though. Throughout his life, Michael used these moments to spur him on.

Two Olympic gold medals, six NBA Championships and 14 MVP awards later.For him, failure is an

it happen.”</b>

				Serena Williams was born on September 26, 1981. Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Oracene Price and Richard Williams, and is the youngest of Price’s five daughters. The family moved to Compton, California, where Williams started playing tennis at the age of four. Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister, Venus Williams.
				<br>
				When Serena Williams was nine, she attended the tennis academy of Rick Macci; Macci began to provide her with additional coaching. In 1995, however, William’s father pulled his daughters (Serena and Venus) out of Macci’s academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home.	<br>

				<br>Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules. Serena Williams is a force to reckon with and her success story is proof. She has won 39 Grand Slam titles including 23 in singles, 14 in women’s doubles, and 2 in mixed doubles.
				<br>Serena Williams also has several Grand Slam Doubles wins to her credit. Along with sister Venus, she won a record 3 doubles gold in the Olympics as a team. Her impeccable record of Grand Slam wins puts her third on the all-time list and second in the open era.

					There was once a time when the Indian Cricket Team was simply filled with the city kids. Due to excellent infrastructure and good scope for the game in cities, many small town boys would not succeed defeating them in the Ranji Trophy. But this man proved it all wrong. MSD had seen a dream, which many feared to see.
					<br><br>
					Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi, Dhoni dared to dream and with courage and guts make that dream a reality. Since a very young age, he idolized Sachin Tendulkar who is known as the God of Cricket and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan. He started his career as a Ticket Collector in Indian Railways. His hard work and never-give-up spirit finally landed him in International Cricket in 2003.
					<br><br>
					In 2007, he led the team a whopping victory in ICC T-20 World Cup. He continues to inspire the younger generation with his brilliant captaincy, and out of the box thinking. The upcoming movie ‘Dhoni – The Untold Story’, is Bollywood’s tribute to his genius. You can watch the trailer here if you have not already.

She became the first Indian woman to bring home the Commonwealth Games wrestling gold in 2010. She achieved this amazing feat in the freestyle 55 kg. It also made her the celebrated golden girl of India.
					<br><br>
					Geeta wasn’t going to be satisfied with just a Commonwealth gold medal. She worked extremely hard to secure a podium finish at the Summer Olympics 2012. Unfortunately, she couldn’t win the repechage round. Even though she lost, she made history. Geeta is the first Indian grappler to qualify for the Olympics.
					<br><br>
					The World Wrestling Championships of 2012 were held in Canada. Geeta lost to Saori Yoshida of Japan in the second round. However, she won both the bouts in the repechage round to come home with the bronze medal. Geeta won another bronze at the Asian Wrestling Championships of 2012. She lost to Kanako Murata from Japan in the first round itself. Fortunately, she got another opportunity in the repechage round. She made the most of it to ensure a podium finish.

					The life of Sandeep Singh is an inspiring true story of the triumph of the human spirit, about a player, who made headlines for his miraculous comeback after an unfortunate accident through sheer determination, hard work and unrelenting passion for the sport. There are not many instances of people getting back from paralysis to running hard on the field with a stick in his hand. Sandeep Singh truly deserves the praise that is being offered to him through The movie ‘Soorma’.
					<br><br>
					<b style="color:black">The tragedy that changed the direction of his life</b><br>
					An RPF officer “accidentally” shot the hockey player, when he was aboard the Shatabdi Express.
					A bullet wound went through all three organs and on the spot he was paralyzed and for him it was the worst day of his life, he just wanted to go and play, whenever he saw the field, he just wanted to go and play, or whenever he saw the match on TV, he was crying from Inside to become a player again
					<br>	
					<b style="color:black"> “A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work”</b><br>
					When Sandeep saw Hockey for the first time after the gunshot, he said to his brother, “Bring my Hockey stick, I want to sleep with my Hockey stick, and I want to again become a hockey player.”
					<br> 
					On further information, they got to know that Sandeep had lost 40 percent of body weight and muscle and he just weighed 55kg, and he had no power to stand up straight and he needed help to do anything. And as we all know, at that age and after such an incident, it is really hard to become a pro athlete. He was almost paralyzed and on the wheelchair for two years of his life<br>
					But he was not the ones amongst giving up on passion. Being the tough guy he was, Singh not only recovered from that serious injury but also established himself again in the Indian team.

					Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini is a world renowned professional football player who plays for Barcelona FC and is also the captain of the Argentine National Team.
					Messi has consistently broken a number of football records and holds two world cups, two UEFA Super cups, three Champions League cups, six La Liga cups and is also the leading goal scorer of all time in both the La Liga and the Champions League.					
					<BR><br>
					Messi was not born in a well off family. His father was a worker in a steel factory and his mother worked part time as a cleaner. 
					Messi had been fascinated by the sport at a very early age and joined his first club at the age of five.
					 Unfortunately, at the age of eleven, Messi was diagnosed of having a deficiency of growth hormones and his treatment to overcome the situation would require about $900 a month.
					
					<BR><br>
					However, this young boy had already managed to raise a number of eyebrows with his impeccable skills and his immense talent with the ball. As such, his strength and determination shone through on the field and he was noticed by the sporting director of Barcelona FC, who offered him a contract on a paper napkin to join the club.  Ever since that incident, Messi has never looked back and has gone on to make a big name for himself internationally, and has garnered a lot of love from football fans all over the world.
					<BR>
					Even after becoming one of the biggest stars in the sport, Messi has not forgotten the difficult times he has faced in his past. Consequently, in 2007, he established the Leo Messi Foundation which is dedicated to provide healthcare and also education to poor and vulnerable children. 
					<br><b style="color:yellow;">Messi is surely a very inspirational figure who has made it big on the basis of his determination and skill and has combated a difficult past to come out on top.</b>

					Phelps was raised in a family of swimmers and joined the prestigious North Baltimore Aquatic Club at age seven. He finished fifth in the 200-metre butterfly at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. At the 2001 U.S. spring nationals, he became at age 15 the youngest world-record holder in men’s swimming when he posted 1 min 54.92 sec in the 200-metre butterfly. He went on that year to win his first international title at the world championships in Fukuoka, Japan. He claimed five medals at the 2002 Pan Pacific championships, including three gold individually. At the U.S. spring nationals in 2003, he became the first male swimmer to claim titles in three different strokes at a single national championship.
                                        <br><br>
					Phelps’s retirement was short-lived, as he announced his return to competitive swimming in April 2014. 
					In October of that year, he was suspended by USA Swimming for six months after he was charged with driving under the influence, his second such 
					arrest; the first had occurred in 2004. Phelps was the American flag-bearer at the opening ceremonies of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, 
					which were his fifth Games, a record for an American male swimmer. There he added to his unparalleled medal count by winning golds in the
					200-metre IM, 4 × 100-metre medley relay, 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay. It was his gold in his signature event, the 200-metre butterfly, that captured the most international attention. 
					The finals of that race featured South Africa’s Chad le Clos, who had beaten Phelps by five-hundredths of a second in the race at the 
					2012 Games and who had exchanged verbal barbs with the American over the following four years. Before the race, cameras caught le Clos warming up in front of Phelps, who fixed an icy stare upon his rival that instantly became a meme on social media platforms. In the following race, Phelps eked out a victory by four-hundredths of a second and had an uncharacteristically exuberant celebration in the pool. Having completed his improbably dominant comeback at the 2016 Games, he again retired from competitive swimming.

					Saina’s attraction towards badminton came mainly from her parent’s dream of becoming a national player. It also helped her a lot because both her parents were badminton players. Once they moved to Hyderabad, she took up badminton as her means of expression and excelled in it.
					<br><br>
					Being born as a girl child in Haryana had its downfalls when her grandmother refused to see her. Despite this, she fought through. Saina had her genes in badminton and her first exposure to it was when she was carried in a pram to the local club where her mother used to play.
					<br><br>				
					She started an early career and was groomed by her coach Arif after which she joined the Gopichand academy. However, expenses got too much for her parent’s but that too took a turn when Saina started winning national tournaments and sponsors took interest in her.
					<br><br>Her achievements are something she is very proud of. She has been the inspiration for many young girls and that according to the badminton star is a lot more than she could have asked for.

					<b>On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India’s premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. But he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, Though he was often used as a substitute fielder. On 11 December 1988, aged 15 years, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. He had also made an unbeaten century in the Ranji Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season.
					<br><br>
His first double century was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo. Tendulkar’s as captain of the Indian cricket team was not very successful. By 1997 the team was performing poorly. After another Test series defeat, That time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned. Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Which was helped to India reach the final.
<br><br>

He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket.On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November. On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground
<br><br>
Sachin Tendulkar’s immense success in cricket is unmatched by other international players, making him a true star for the sport.

					When we come across a legend we desire to be one as they have so much to teach us. Among these legends is the name of a golfer who showed that nothing was impossible. Today that luminary is known to us as Tiger Woods. 
					<br><br> 
					Woods not only started playing golf as a profession but also helped in inflating the popularity of this formidable game. His success in the field made him a star golfer today. But achievements in golf were not all that mattered to him. He believed that honesty and decency in your profession is also accountable. 
 					<br><br>
					This gave many people around the world a hope to work in their professions faithfully. His father had guided him on his strenuous journey to achieve fame.
					<br><br> 	 
					In one of his quotes he explains that his father never pressurized him for this sport. His own passion for the sport gave him a successful career today. When you are earning from something that you are passionate about then there is no stress or tension that regular people face every day at work. So, money is also not a problem if one has a job which he/she loves. 
 					<br><br>
					Woods showed the world that following your passion can give you a career that you will always be proud of. You would never have to feel the depression and will always be happy and satisfied in life. Even though Woods had motivators in life, but the real fight was his own. 
 <br><br>
Similarly everyone’s battle has to be fought by them. Motivation from such legends can be there but it is up to us to make up our minds and fulfill our dreams in life, just like he did.

					Mary Kom was born in 1983 in a poor family in Kangathei, Manipur.She is the first daughter of Shri M Tonpa Kom and Smt M Akham Kom. They belonged to Kangathel village, a small village in Churachandpur district in Manipur.
					<br><br>
					It was the success of Dingko Singh that inspired her to become a boxer. The rise of Dingko Singh and the demonstration of women boxers at the 5th National Games (Manipur) inspired her. When Dingko Singh returned from Bangkok (Asian Games) with a gold, I thought I should give it a try. Dingko’s success triggered a revolution of sort in Manipur and surprisingly I found that I was not the only girl who was drawn into boxing,” she said.
					<br><br>
					She began boxing in 2000 and was a quick learner who preferred to be put through the same paces as the boys around her. “In just two weeks, I had learnt all the basics. I guess I had God-given talent for boxing.”
					<br><br>
					“I still remember I was castigated by my father who said with a battered and bruised face, I should not expect to get married. He was furious that I took to boxing – a taboo for women – and he did not have the slightest idea about it. But my passion for the sport had got the better of me and I thank my cousins who coaxed and cajoled my father into eventually giving his nod. I’m happy that I did not let anybody down,” she told in September 2004.

					<p style="color:red;"><b>“Don’t give up as there is always a next time. Think that if Mary Kom, a mother of two, can do it, why can’t you?"</b></p>
